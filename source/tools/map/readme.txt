wingitCLI.exe is a modified version of Cearn's Wingit application,
which has been deprecated in favor of using Grit, which is distributed
with devkitPro's libnds.  New projects should use grit instead of 
wingitCLI, which was a customized version created for building Anguna
before grit was created.

Most of the code of wingitCLI is written and owned by Jasper Vijn (Cearn),
and falls under whatever license he has chosen, not Anguna's license.

Thanks to Cearn for the original code.
