-retesting dungeon 4


--BUGS
-add low power mode for lid closed
-better sound lib



---FIXED----
-don't let enemies spawn right in front of a cave/stairs/door
-using last potion still shows a 1
-bushes bleed red.
-save and continue resets subscreen to item screen
-continue should continue from where you saved!?
-no animation on diagonal movement
-traps not get reset
-giant bat boss locks up game
-When I talk to the merchant near the lake dungeon (bottom-left), the top of the tree dissapears.
-Saving and quitting in a dark room will dump you into a black screen
-With enemy database showing, entering and exiting caves will mess up the text
	that tells what L/R do at the bottom
-Changing to enemy database at beginning of the game, then killing the first enemy
	will show messed up text on screen
-stray pixel on main menu
-transparency on icon
-crates block bullets?
-gradient on lantern surround?
-heart from grass in graveyard gone if you don't get it?


----maybe?
-make map more obvious?
-better main menu?
-coming out of stairs more obvious?



-Fix outdoor music (new audio lib?)
-add theme music (no need?)

-Better error checking on save/load??
-game over in darkness
